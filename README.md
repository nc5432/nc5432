- Hi, I’m @nc5432
- I’m interested in software development, game development, and artificial intelligence.
- I’m currently making software for Nexteer Automotive, making games in Godot, and working on AR projects in Unity for the HoloLense 2.
- I am moving to using self-hosted solutions to many services, so my personal projects will now be hosted on https://gitea.nolancasey.click. I will likely still use Github for class projects.
